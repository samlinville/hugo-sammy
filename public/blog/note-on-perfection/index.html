            <h1>A Note on Perfection</h1>
            <p>The first step is admitting you have a problem</p>
        </header>
        <p>I have been posting content to <a href="http://samlinville.com">http://samlinville.com</a> since about 2006, when I was in the sixth grade. Back then, I used a pre-designed template from Microsoft Publisher to post daily blog updates about life in middle school. A year later, armed with a copy of Microsoft Expression Web, I started kicking the tires on HTML and CSS, and a handful of years after that, I used my first CSS framework: Zurb Foundation 4.</p>
<p>Through all of those years, and in the years since, this domain has hosted various attempts at blogs, many iterations on a design portfolio, and occaisionally, nothing at all. None of my attempts have lasted, and I&rsquo;ve been deeply dissatisfied by each of them.</p>
<p>I started reflecting on this recently, when I felt the itch to yet again try to build a site for writing, ideas, and projects. <strong>I want to be able to look back in another 14 years and see a record of the things I did and thought about.</strong></p>
<p>There are three things that have historically kept me from accomplishing this goal:</p>
<ol>
<li>I&rsquo;m a designer at heart, and I nitpick my UI designs until I hate them and can&rsquo;t bear looking at them.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve chosen publishing tools and workflows that have, more often than not, made it difficult to publish content consistently, and my site becomes stale.</li>
<li><strong>Most critically, I&rsquo;ve never been good at showing things that aren&rsquo;t <em>perfect</em>.</strong> I&rsquo;ve gotten pretty good at combatting this at work, but it never seems to translate to my side projects and hobbies.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="this-time-im-doing-things-differently">This time, I&rsquo;m doing things differently.</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this, you&rsquo;re probably looking at a website that&rsquo;s <em>not quite there yet.</em> And while I&rsquo;m sorry about that, I&rsquo;m also not sorry at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time thinking about how to set myself up for success here, and I have a few core principles I&rsquo;m sticking to.</p>
<ul>
<li>Perfection isn&rsquo;t the goal; I just want to share my work in whatever form I have time to publish it.</li>
<li>I chose a static site generator (Hugo) and workflow (GitHub + Netlify) that&rsquo;s flexible enough to let me evolve the design over time without requiring me to reorient my content and data each time. It&rsquo;s also really <em>easy</em> to publish content this way.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s okay if some parts of this site don&rsquo;t look great all the time. At the time of writing, my blog index page is atrocious. I hate looking at it, but I haven&rsquo;t had room in my priorities to fix it yet. And, dear reader, that&rsquo;s going to be okay with me from now on.</li>
</ul>
<p>The internet is a really marvelous place, full of deeply nerdy and bright-eyed people who want to share their ideas. I desperately want to join in and contribute to this gargantuan knowledgebase and record of life, and I think that this time, I might just get it right.</p>
