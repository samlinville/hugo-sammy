        <p>I&rsquo;m Sam, a product manager and designer. My goal as a design practitioner is to create spaces and tools that make people feel like they&rsquo;re at home, because people who confident in their surroundings and circumstances are happier, stronger people. To this end, I spend a lot of time thinking about how to foster confidence, security, inclusivity, and mastery in the products I build.</p>
<p>At the moment, I&rsquo;m at Stanford University getting an MBA at the Graduate School of Business. Looking forward into my career post-GSB, I&rsquo;m really interested in pulling design and business closer together in the enterprise space. Based on my own experience, I think a closer marriage of these groups will create a better working environment for everyone, and better products too.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m not working or studying, I really enjoy cooking. After college, I realized I wasn&rsquo;t getting the opportunity to make things with my hands anymore. All of my creativity and craftsmanship existed on a computer in an office. Cooking was the answer‚Äì it&rsquo;s all of the craft and critical thinking of physical design, plus you get to eat a great dinner.</p>
<p>I also have recently built a homelab to solve some computing needs that I&rsquo;ve found. The ability to create and self-host your own software and other open source applications is super empowering, and I&rsquo;m learning <em>so much</em> about computing and networking that I didn&rsquo;t learn in my graphic design education. Stay tuned for a monstrosity of a blog post about my efforts here!</p>
