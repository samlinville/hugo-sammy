I'm Sam, a product manager and designer. My goal as a design practitioner is to create spaces and tools that make people feel like they're at home, because people who confident in their surroundings and circumstances are happier, stronger people. To this end, I spend a lot of time thinking about how to foster confidence, security, inclusivity, and mastery in the products I build.

At the moment, I'm at Stanford University getting an MBA at the Graduate School of Business. Looking forward into my career post-GSB, I'm really interested in pulling design and business closer together in the enterprise space. Based on my own experience, I think a closer marriage of these groups will create a better working environment for everyone, and better products too.

When I'm not working or studying, I really enjoy cooking. After college, I realized I wasn't getting the opportunity to make things with my hands anymore. All of my creativity and craftsmanship existed on a computer in an office. Cooking was the answerâ€“ it's all of the craft and critical thinking of physical design, plus you get to eat a great dinner.

I also have recently built a homelab to solve some computing needs that I've found. The ability to create and self-host your own software and other open source applications is super empowering, and I'm learning _so much_ about computing and networking that I didn't learn in my graphic design education. Stay tuned for a monstrosity of a blog post about my efforts here!
